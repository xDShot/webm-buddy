webm-buddy
==========

Some bydlo-code to make creating WebM files easier. Uses 2-pass mode and tries to fit to a specified file size.

As usual, run with -h to get a brief description of allowed parameters.

Requires that you have ffmpeg with libvpx and libvorbis.

TODO
====

* Support videos where number of audio tracks is not 1 or 0;
* Nicer feedback;
* Multi-segment cutting.
